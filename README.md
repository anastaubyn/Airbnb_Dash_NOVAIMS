## An online dashboard created using Dash and deployed using Heroku

This [Dashboard](https://airbnb-dash-novaims.herokuapp.com/) was created for the Data Visualization class of the Advanced Analytics master programme (NOVA IMS). Some performance constraints may exist since it's running on free tier. Reloading the page may be necessary.

## Objectives

The dashboard explores datasets containing Airbnb listings from 3 cities in three different tabs: Lisbon, Paris and Amsterdam. For each of these cities the same information was retrieved. We created a map showing how distributed in space the listings are and analyzed metrics like the price, rating and room types.
